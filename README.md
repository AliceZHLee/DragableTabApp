* This App is a Microsoft desktop app. It applies a powerful package called "dragablz" which enables tabs to be dragged in and out freely.
* There are two tabs inside the main window and you can drag them outside the main win to generate a new window or you can drag tabs within the main win's layout to put the tabs at top/bottom/right/left dock panel.
* If you want to see real data using the embedded API functions inside this app, you need to have account for SGX and insert them into DragableTabApp/FixAdapter/config/fix.cfg file
